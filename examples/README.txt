To try nvGraphy :

1) take both GPU1 and GPU2 files and drop them to nvGraphy.exe
You will see the differences between the two experiments. Good to compare to GPUs, for example

2) FRAPSfps : this file is the result of FRAPS capture.

3) FRAPSframetimes : this file is also the result of FRAPS

4) nvPerfHUDDX9 : a csv generated by the old NVIDIA nvPerfHUD

5) OGL_incremental_calls_log : a timing of a scene, with performance counters
